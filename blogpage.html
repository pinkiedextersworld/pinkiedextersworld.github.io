        <p><b>Cry me a river.</b></p>
        <p>Hi all, today is a very very very sad day... Just this morning, something terrible happened. I could barely bare the immense pain that my nerve endings sent towards me...My vision almost gave in to the pain. My life flashed past me. I was thinking of all the wrong doings in my life... I prayed to god for relieving me of this unbearable pain. The pain that i had brought upon myself, for stubbing my toe on the table leg.</p>

        <p><b>Was it really worth it?</b></p>
        <p>Hello, my dear fans and follower. This date marks the day that I have made the biggest decision in my life. Just this morning, I woke up just like any other day, however what lies waiting for me was different. This morning, I had to choose between strawberry or chocolate milk for my cereal. I pondered for almost 5 minute! Before coming to the decision of not eating cereal this morning. Was my decision right? Was eating bread because I could not decide which flavour of milk to drink really worth it?</p>

        <p><b>The memories.</b></p>
        <p>The memories falshed through my brain. The same day last year, something important happened. On this day of last year, I ended the life of a whole colony. On this day last year, I took a lot of lives. What should I do with this memory of taking lives? How should i rid of this memory. This memory of placing ant poison and letting them bring back to their colony. Save me.</p>
