            <p id="photocertdesc"><b>Photography.</b><br>Since young, I have always been fascinated by the world of photography. The placement of every tiny detail in a photo would thrill me. I believed that the meaning of my life was photograhpy so, i seized every chance i had to go for photography courses. This one is achieved at a young age of primary 4.</p>

            <p id="comcertdesc"><b>Computer Skills.</b><br>Apart from photography, i had one other interest. It was computers. My attention was always drawn in to anything computer related. Each time my father opened up a CPU, I was always the most excited. This pushed me to participate in various international assesments for computer skills. I am actually very proud of this one. It signifies that I scored in the top 10% of the whole sinagpore!</p>
