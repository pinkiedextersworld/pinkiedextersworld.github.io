                     <p>Hi all, today is a very very very sad day... Just this morning, something terrible happened. I could barely bare the immense pain that my nerve endings sent towards me...My vision almost gave in to the pain. My life flashed past me. I was thinking of all the wrong doings in my life... I prayed to god for relieving me of this unbearable pain. The pain that i had brought upon myself, for stubbing my toe on the table leg.</p>
